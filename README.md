## Dystopian related
### By Franz Kafka:
• The Trial: Lex discusses this novel in detail, noting that the main character is arrested for an unspecified crime and navigates a labyrinthine legal system where the trial becomes a "permanent condition".
• The Castle: Lex describes this work as having a similar description to The Trial regarding the "absurd inaccessibility of those in authority" and "nightmarish bureaucracy".
• Metamorphosis: Lex quotes the famous opening lines of this work, where the character Gregor Samsa wakes up transformed into a gigantic insect.
• In the Penal Colony.
• Hunger Artist: Lex notes this story is relevant to the modern-day "attention economy" and the desire for fame.
Other Dystopian and Related Literature: Lex states that it is often useful to read works of "over-the-top dystopian variety" to better understand the real world and destructive paths humanity might take. He includes:
• 1984.
• Animal Farm.
• Brave New World.
• The Plague by Albert Camus.
