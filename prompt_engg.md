# Prompt engineering Techniques
- COT Chain of thoughts, instead of a single prompt ask to think in a stepwise fashion. May add some examples
- Self consistency: Ask multiple expert opinion and choose the one with consistency in the answers.
- Tree of thoughts for more open eneded promblem solving. Insted of one liner chain of though can brnach out and backtrack
- REACT: reason and act, like LLM calling tools, running code and checking answer and prepare for next step
# Best practices
- use exampels, one shot few shots
- Use string action verb, tell model exactly what to do
- use instructions over constraints. Dont use these libraries vs use these libraries
